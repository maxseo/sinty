// The open project, for everything that acts on it. A project is three names
// at once and they come apart: the id is what it *is* (the URL, the key the
// world is under), the folder is where it lives, and the display name is what
// the user calls it. Resolving the URL to a project happens once, in
// ProjectPage; this is that answer, kept current as the project is renamed
// underneath the editor, and as a draft is saved or a project is moved and its
// folder goes with it.
